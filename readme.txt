== Description ==

A Widget that uses jQuery (if you want) and Foursquare to fade in/out each checkin for any specific feed.  You can set how many checkins, how long they stay before they fade in/out, or just list however many without the fadein/out feature. 

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload the plugin into the plugins directory and then activate it. 
2. Go to the Widgets and drag the jFoursquare bar into a sidebar.
3. Make sure you put the Foursquare Feed's URL.
4. Add some CSS to you liking.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the paranoia feature?

This allows you to display your checkins, but only after a certain amount of hours.  This is so you can check in somewhere in Tasmania, not letting the world know you are out of the country and people break in to your house.  I know, crazy, but smart.
